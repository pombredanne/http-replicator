http-replicator-4.0alpha2
-------------------------

This release fixes an omission of the previous one: the inclusion of the GPL
licence file. This clears the way for packaging initiatives on linux
distributions and other operating systems. Other than this just minor fixes;
the serious work unfortunately got lost on a crashed disk.


http-replicator-4.0alpha1
-------------------------

The first release in more than three years; result of my decision to give up on
existing code and rewrite replicator from scratch. The new version breaks with
python's built-in asyncore framework and replaces it with a much more flexible
'fiber' scheduler based on python generators. For implementation details see
README.devel which is included in the package. To the user the new flexibility
shows as a long new features list, which includes often requested features such
as server-side download resuming, ftp support, bandwidth shaping, ipv6 support.
Known issues have been solved such as the frozen download problem and the race
condition that prevented joining of simultaneously started downloads. Most of
the old functionality is unchanged, except for cache browsing which will be
restored in a later alpha release. For basic usuage instructions please see the
README.user documentation.

The server has been tested on OS X Leopard and Debian Etch, both i386
architectures. Users with access to other platforms or architectures are highly
encouraged to report their findings on the http-replicator-users mailing list.
Note the unit-test script which checks replicator's functionality on 16
different points, using standard gnu tools. Feature requests and general
discussion are preferably sent to the mailing list as well.
