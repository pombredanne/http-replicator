The FIBER module
================

To be able to serve an arbitrary number of HTTP clients simultaneously,
replicator separates independent transactions in fibers. Fibers can be though of
as threads, except that they lack the overhead of real posix threads. Quoted
from wikipedia [1]:

  "Typically fibers are implemented entirely in userspace. As a result, context
  switching between fibers in a process does not require any interaction with
  the kernel at all and is therefore extremely efficient: a context switch can
  be performed by locally saving the CPU registers used by the currently
  executing fiber and loading the registers required by the fiber to be
  executed. Since scheduling occurs in userspace, the scheduling policy can be
  more easily tailored to the requirements of the program's workload."

The last point can be considered an advantage over real threads, which have no
control over place or time of switching and therefore require special care of
being thread-safe. Fibers, on the other hand, switch at fixed points in code,
which makes thread-safety considerably easier to achieve. The downside of fixed
switching points is the risk of blocking calls in between, stalling the entire
application. As the article continues:

  "However, the use of blocking system calls in fibers can be problematic. If a
  fiber performs a system call that blocks, the other fibers in the process are
  unable to run until the system call returns. A typical example of this problem
  is when performing I/O: most programs are written to perform I/O
  synchronously. When an I/O operation is initiated, a system call is made, and
  does not return until the I/O operation has been completed. In the intervening
  period, the entire process is "blocked" by the kernel and cannot run, which
  starves other fibers in the same process from executing."

The above problem is a consequence of 'co-operative scheduling', which means
that "a running fiber must explicitly 'yield' to allow another fiber to run". 
In practice - or at least, replicator's practice, one needs only assure that
fibers yield right before every I/O operation, and are resumed only after this
operation is guaranteed not to block. To this end, fibers communicate the
current state of communication before yielding to the scheduler. Three states
are supported:

 * RECV: fiber is awaiting data
 * SEND: fiber is queueing data
 * WAIT: fiber is sleeping

Argument to the first two states is the target socket, which the scheduler adds
to the total pool of 'select' monitored sockets. The third state will either
wake the fiber after a certain time (WAIT #seconds), wake together with the
first other fiber to resume operation (WAIT None), or force a queue run (WAIT
0). The latter is useful in case heavy processing risks stalling the server even
without blocking system calls. Note again that the responsibility of yielding in
time is with the programmer.

As of version 2.2 the Python language includes on object that can very easily be
turned into the fiber just described: the generator [2]. Complete with a yield
statement to both put the fiber on hold and communitate the state to the
server, this is precisely the kind of "resumable function" we are looking for.
Other implementations of this idea speak of weightless threads [3], coroutines
[4], microthreads, tasklets, etc. Also notable in this respect is Stackless
Python [5], introducing true microthreads in the language itself, and stackless
in PyPy [6]. And, lastly, there is the asyncore module [7] that is very similar
to fibers except for its rigid framework. Indeed, the previous versions of
replicator were based on this.

A Python fiber terminates when either it returns or raises an exception. The
scheduler takes care that exceptions are handled without interfering with other
fibers and prints an error message or, optionally, a complete traceback message.
As for printing, the default behaviour is to withhold all output until the fiber
terminates in order to have a better view of past per-fiber operation. This
behaviour can be changed to direct output. Fibers need not worry about this; it
is all handled by the scheduler which replaces sys.stdout with the configured
printer upon fiber activation. This to prevent tedius passing around of various
log objects.

Remains to explain how the system is put in action. This is by the fiber
module's spawn method, which opens a socket at the specified localhost port and
starts the main loop listening for incoming connections. For every such
connection it creates an instance of the specified generator function. Two
additional arguments are a timeout time, the time of inactivity after which a
fiber is terminated, and a debug boolean flag to control printed output. The
main loop is exited by sending SIGHUP or ^C, in either case raising a
KeyboardInterrupt. Finally, note that a valid generator:

 * takes two arguments: 1) the connecting socket and 2) its address
 * yields only objects of type WAIT, SEND, RECV

Other than that there are no restrictions. For example fiber code, read on.

HTTP Replicator
===============

Now that fibers are defined, let's turn back momentarily to the beginning of
this text - to be able to serve an arbitrary number of HTTP clients
simultaneously, replicator separates independent transactions in fibers.
Transactions, now, are complete lines of communication between client and
server, from HTTP request to HTTP response - whether coming from a remote server
or generated by the proxy - and all communication in between. Detailed behaviour
depends on three things:

 * client request
 * current state of cache
 * current downloads

The client request is a property of the transaction and will not have to be
communicated amongst threads. Furthermore, all threads have independent access
to the cache, which leaves only the currently running downloads as data to be
shared globally. Other than that, all transaction threads can run completely
indepent of each other and need only be switched on and off at suitable times.
